Communications Game 07/06/2011 Concept by Tangible Dream

A play off of Khan Academy gaming system for training communication skills to players.

It'll require a persistent backend for player scores and stats, as well as the warehousing of questions.
Let's talk about how we'd like to build this out.  Languages? Gui vs. Browser App, etc.

I thought about this a little bit.

Class concept

1. A base concept gives you proficiency if you answer 10 questions in a row correctly. (
2. A advanced concept gives you proficiency if you answer 10 questions in a row correctly 
	and have proficiency in all dependent concepts both base and advanced.
3. An advanced concept unlocks only when proficiency is achieved in all dependent concepts
4. A challenge concept promotes integration of several concepts.
5. A challenge concept unlocks when proficiency is achieved in all dependent concepts.
6. A challenge concept is won after 50 questions are answered correctly*

Class question

1. A question tests proficiency for a given concept.
2. A question can be formed in any the following ways...
	a. fill in the blank.
	b. true or false.
	c. multiple choice.
	d. matched pairs
	e. other?
3. Questions can have score hurting hints.
4. Questions can come in written, picture, sound, or video form.

Front language

If we are going to take advantage of relevant video links the way Khan Academy does, 
I suggest we make it a browser app and employ Ruby/ ROR.

Back language

For persistence, and just to be challenging, can we have mongo?  Otherwise I'm fine with MySql or some such.
